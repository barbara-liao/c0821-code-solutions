Describe the flow of the code in writing, including the client, server and database.
How does the code work?

User can sign up.
  From the rendered auth form, user can click the "Sign Up" button or the "Register now" a tag, which will bring
  them to the hashed page where they can register. User inputs username and password. As they type, the state is continuously
  being updated. Once the submit button is clicked, the req is created and the req.body is assigned the stringified version of
  the state. A "POST" method is then called through the fetch method at '/api/auth/sign-up.
  The server then checks to see if a username and password is entered. If one or all are missing, an error will be thrown.
  The password is hashed and then inserted into the database and a 201 success status is sent back.
  If it is a success, then the hash router will be updated and the user will be taken to the sign in page.

User can sign in.
  On the sign in page, user inputs username and password. As they type, the state is continuously being updated.
  Once the submit button is clicked, the req is created and req.body is assigned the stringified version of the
  state. A "POST" method is then called through the fetch method at '/api/auth/sign-in'.
  The server checks to see if a user name is entered. If one or all are missing, an error will be thrown.
  The server checks the hashed password in the system against the entered in password using .verify. If it doesn't match, an error will be thrown.
  If it matches, a user payload and token is then created and passed into the onSignIn method, which is the handleSignIn method.
  The handleSignIn method is run, which sets the 'react-context-jwt' name as the token. The state is set and page re-rendered to the home page.

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).
  If the page is reloaded, the server checks for a token in the localStorage. If there is one, the state is set with the token and
  page re-rendered to what it was.

User can sign out.
  If the user clicks the sign out button, the handleSignOut method is called, which removes the 'react-context-jwt' item
  from the local storage and sets state to user:null, which rerenders the page, bringing the user back to the sign in page.
